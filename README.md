### Hi there 🙋‍♂️

**Glad to see you here!** :star_struck: <br> I'm Ali Kartal from Turkey. I have an intermediate level of English. I spend most of my time learning software and software development. The green dots on my [**GitHub** Profile](https://github.com/alikartalonline?tab=repositories) represent my journey :running_man: I am currently looking for job opportunities as "Jr. Front-end Developer" and I’m currently learning ***JavaScript***. You can **find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alikartalonline/)**. I also enjoy editing videos and pictures, taking nature photos and drawing pictures with charcoal 😎.

## Skills and Experience

* ⚛ React (*I'm still in the learning phase...*:fire:)
* 📷 Adobe Photoshop 
* 🎥 Adobe After Effects
